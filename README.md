# Open Information Security Risk Universe

<img src="cover.jpg" width=400 align="middle">

The Open Information Security Risk Universe (oisru) is a framework for describing information security risks independently of models or methods of analysing risks.

Information Security Risks are decomposed into Sources, Events and Consequences and Risk Factors for frequency and severity are included.

A PDF of the current version of the oisru is available in the repository [here](https://github.com/oracuk/oisru/blob/master/oisru.pdf).
