## Risks

It’s key to understand that a risk event alone is not a risk, at it's simplest a risk can be a single risk event and the single consequence of that event.

However, it is likely as we develop our risk scenario that they will consist of the combination or one or more sources, one or more risk events and one or more consequences. 

Risk events may lead to other risk events within the scenario. For example a *software exploit* may lead to *unauthorised access to a system* that then causes consequences.

## Risk Scenarios

Risk scenarios are the business-context descriptive narrative form of the risks facing your business. The risk scenarios are useful in communicating with stakeholders about the risk as they feel like real-world stories they recognise from their own experience. Risk scenarios tend to be specific to business functions and their environment.

For example:

**Title:** *"Accidental Market Sensitive Information Leak.*"  
**Description:** *"During the reporting period a member of the accounting team, under time pressure, accidentally sends a draft of the annual report to an employee at our technology outsourcer who has the same name as our Chief Financial Officer as a result of address auto-complete in their email software. If the draft leaks it could lead to market sensitive information being published ahead of the publication of the report which could lead to a regulatory sanction and trigger insider trading*".

When writing relevant risk scenarios the analyst should consider:

* **Context** - *'Who'* - Groups, Individuals, Organisations
* **Triggers** - *'Why'*, - Motivations, Goals
* **Event** - *'What, How'* - Activities, Objectives, Targets
* **Timelines** - *'When, How long'* - Triggering Events, Opportunity
* **Location** - *'Where*' - Geography, Networks
* **Responses** - *'So what'* - Harms, Likely following events

While the description of the risk scenario under consideration can be tailored to use language appropriate to the organisation in scope and the stakeholders or experts that must consider it the underlying statement of the risk that scenario represents can, and should, be standardised using the Open Information Security Risk Universe.

## Risk Statements

At it's simplest a risk scenario can be translated into a risk statement using the following structure:

There is a risk that \<**source**> causes \<**event**> occurs leading to \<**outcome**> that causes \<**consequence**>.

An example of a minimal risk statement structured as above is:

“*There is a risk that an employee accidentally emails data to an external recipient leading to an information breach which results in regulatory fines.*”

By ensuring that every risk scenario is also formally stated as a risk statement it allows comparison between scenarios as well as identifying what coverage of the OSIRU is currently being considered by the organisation and whether that is appropriate.
